# Lecture 37
1. Programming class
2. Developing codes for forward and backward Euler method
3. Using Newton Raphson in backward Euler method
4. Using Fixed-point iteration in backward Euler method
5. Demo showing forward Euler could be unstable whereas backward Euler remains stable
6. Demo that shows while backward Euler is unconditionally stable but can be very inaccurate
