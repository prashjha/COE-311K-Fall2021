# Textbook
We will use the following book as a main reference

> **Applied Numerical Methods with Matlab for Engineers & Scientists** by *Steven C. Chapra*. 3rd Ed., McGraw-Hill, 2012

> Note: 3rd and 4th editions are somewhat syllabus so you could also use 4th edition of the book, however, instructor and TA/LA will use 3rd edition is main reference.
